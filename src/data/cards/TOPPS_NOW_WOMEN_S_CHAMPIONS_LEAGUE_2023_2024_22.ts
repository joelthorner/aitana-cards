*THE DEADLY DUO*

---

FC Barcelona’s deadly duo Aitana Bonmatí and Alexia Putellas both scored in the Spanish side’s UEFA Women’s Champions League final victory over Olympique Lyonnais.

It was a night that showed the best of Bonmatí and Putellas as FC Barcelona beat the French side 2-0 to win their third UEFA Women’s Champions League title. Bonmatí ran the game in typical fashion and opened the scoring in the 63rd minute. Caldentey played the midfielder in down the left and Bonmatí’s dinked finish was deflected into the goal. FC Barcelona legend Putellas came on in the 92nd minute and put the game beyond doubt three minutes later. Claudia Pina’s clever cut-back found Putellas in the box who launched a ferocious shot into the goal to make it 2-0 and seal the victory. A wonderful night for two of FC Barcelona’s, and the game’s, greatest players.
