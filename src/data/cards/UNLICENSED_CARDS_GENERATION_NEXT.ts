AITANA BONMATÍ  
SPAIN  

MIDFIELDER  

As Barcelona won the Champions League for the second time in their history, Bonmatí was named the tournament’s best player. In terms of her style, she is perhaps the best representation in the women’s game of a stand-out midfielder: terrific technique, a wonderful touch and an ability to play in tight spaces.
